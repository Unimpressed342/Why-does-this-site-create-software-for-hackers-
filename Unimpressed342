Hi i am writing to see if there is a way to find out who and how this account was created using my personal information? I only came accross thiss account because my phone was being hacked and this website kept popping up everywhere. The account was 5139923 which is the numbers from two of my email adresses that i no longer have control of. I tried to delete the account and some repo card showed up in my phone so idk if thw account is still deleted or what. Also, i keep replacing phones and they keep being disabled by something that alqays pops up from github. Does this website only make software to track amd stalk people or is there anything good to github? My experience around this website has been terrifying.
